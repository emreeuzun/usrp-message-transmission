# USRP B210 QPSK & QAM Message Transmission

This project demonstrates over-the-air message transmission using QPSK and QAM modulation schemes with the USRP B210 and MATLAB.  
The system transmits a "Hello World" message using software-defined radio techniques.

## ðŸ§© Based on Original MATLAB Code

The base code was originally obtained from the official MATLAB documentation and examples.  
We have further developed and modified the code for our custom use case.

ðŸ”— Original MATLAB example:

## ðŸ“Œ Modifications & Contributions
- 16-QAM modulation support implemented
- Improved visualization and BER calculations
- Added compatibility for our local USRP B210 setup
- Added Consetllation diagrams for both 16-QAM and QPSK

## ðŸ’» Requirements

- MATLAB R2023a or later
- Communications Toolbox
- USRP Support Package
- USRP B210 hardware
